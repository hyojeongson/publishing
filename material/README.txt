A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/nw/pen/rVdPQW.

 Extending a earlier pen (http://codepen.io/nw/pen/VYdXee) to visualize the 'Elevation' section of Google's design guidelines (http://www.google.com/design/spec/what-is-material/elevation-shadows.html#elevation-shadows-elevation-android-).

Note: the elevation is exaggerated - change the $elevationScaleFactor variable in the SCSS to 1 for more accurate values.
